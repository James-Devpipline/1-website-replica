Homework 1/24/2023
Given the link in the class chat (Twenty twenty two theme),
replicate the html structure. I want to see how you
approach and breakdown a website. You will probably use
almost all of the elements that we've learned so far.
We will present these in class on Friday.

	Remember, if you can't figure something out,
	I need a synopsis of what you tried, and what you 
	learned in your attempts.
